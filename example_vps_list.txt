# SECURITY NOTES:
# ================
# 1. NEVER commit this file with real passwords to version control
# 2. Use strong, unique passwords for each VPS
# 3. Consider using SSH keys instead of passwords for better security
# 4. Regularly rotate VPS credentials
# 5. Only use VPS that you own or have explicit permission to test

# USAGE:
# ======
# This file format is for future bulk import functionality
# Currently, you need to add VPS nodes through the TUI interface:
# 1. Start the C2: ./start.sh
# 2. Select [1] VPS Management
# 3. Select [1] Add VPS
# 4. Enter details for each VPS manually

# RECOMMENDED VPS SPECIFICATIONS:

# Recommended: 2+ CPU, 2GB+ RAM, 20GB+ Storage
# Network: Unrestricted outbound connections

# GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION:

# COST CONSIDERATIONS:
# ====================
# - Use smallest instance sizes for testing
# - Hourly billing recommended for short-term tests
