SECURITY NOTES:

================

1. NEVER commit this file with real passwords to version control

2. Use strong, unique passwords for each VPS

3. Consider using SSH keys instead of passwords for better security

4. Regularly rotate VPS credentials

5. Only use VPS that you own or have explicit permission to test

USAGE:

======

This file format is for future bulk import functionality

Currently, you need to add VPS nodes through the TUI interface:

1. Start the C2: ./start.sh

2. Select [1] VPS Management

3. Select [1] Add VPS

4. Enter details for each VPS manually

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION:

========================

For best results, distribute VPS across:

- Multiple regions (US, EU, Asia)

COST CONSIDERATIONS:

====================

- Use smallest instance sizes for testing

- Hourly billing recommended for short-term tests
